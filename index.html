       <p>Hello, my name is Belen Cuevas (she/her), and I am an emerging professional furthering my education in Application Development at Year Up Puget Sound and Contemporary Business at Renton Technical College. Through Year Up, I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am a member of our Student Ambassadors program. Through RTC, I am learning the fundamentals of creating and/or managing a business.</p> 

        <p>As a first-generation Latina woman breaking into STEM, I want to inspire women and Latinos to break walls down and achieve career roles that aren't usually advertised for us. My cultural and familial experiences instilled in me a strong work ethic and a sense of dedication. I have worked in a small business restaurant and big corporate groceries stores, where I was able to connect with many diverse people. The communication skills I gained from my previous jobs have led me to discover my passion for the evolving topics of business, technology, and finances.</p>
        
    <p>My values include spending time with my family and friends and ensuring I live a healthy life so I can be successful. I love to expand my knowledge by discovering new books and take on new challenges.</p>
